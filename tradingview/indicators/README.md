In order for ATR ITPM STYLE to work - you need to select candles (but not heikin ashi ones, because otherwise numbers are incorrect provided by atr). Ideally it should be lines, but if you going for anything different than simple candles (not heikin ashi ones) or lines - check if ATR ITPM STYLE works in excel - meaning are you getting same results in TW and in EXCEL.

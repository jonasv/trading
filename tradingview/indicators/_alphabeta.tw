//SHOULD BE USED TOGETHER WITH "Alpha" INDICATOR
// Alpha
// Alpha is a measure of the active return on an investment, the performance of that investment compared with a suitable market index. 
// An alpha of 1% means the investment's return on investment over a selected period of time was 1% better than the market during that same period;
// a negative alpha means the investment underperformed the market. Alpha, along with beta, is one of two key coefficients in the capital asset pricing model 
// used in modern portfolio theory and is closely related to other important quantities such as standard deviation, R-squared and the Sharpe ratio.
// In modern financial markets, where index funds are widely available for purchase, alpha is commonly used to judge the performance of mutual
// funds and similar investments. As these funds include various fees normally expressed in percent terms, the fund has to maintain an alpha greater 
// than its fees in order to provide positive gains compared with an index fund. Historically, the vast majority of traditional funds have had negative 
// alphas, which has led to a flight of capital to index funds and non-traditional hedge funds.
// It is also possible to analyze a portfolio of investments and calculate a theoretical performance, most commonly using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). 
// Returns on that portfolio can be compared with the theoretical returns, in which case the measure is known as Jensen's alpha. This is useful for non-traditional
// or highly focused funds, where a single stock index might not be representative of the investment's holdings.

// Beta
//beta (Î² or beta coefficient) of an investment indicates whether the investment is more or less volatile than the market. 
//In general, a beta less than 1 indicates that the investment is less volatile than the market,
//while a beta more than 1 indicates that the investment is more volatile than the market. Volatility is measured as the fluctuation of the price around the mean.
//Beta is a measure of the risk arising from exposure to general market movements as opposed to idiosyncratic factors. 
//The market portfolio of all investable assets has a beta of exactly 1 (here the S&P500). A beta below 1 can indicate either an investment with lower volatility than the market, 
//or a volatile investment whose price movements are not highly correlated with the market. 
//An example of the first is a treasury bill: the price does not go up or down a lot, so it has a low beta. 
//An example of the second is gold. The price of gold does go up and down a lot, but not in the same direction or at the same time as the market

// Computes the covariance (as a percentage change) between 2 symbols.
// The observations used are selected as follow:
// -We start from the current period and go backwards an user selected length.
// -For each period we take the closing price.
// -The step in between periods is the timeframe duration that we are currently viewing.
// -We change from closing prices to percentage change between the current period and previous one. ( Xn = (Xn - Xn-1)/Xn-1 * 100 )
